# tf-imfit

TensorFlow-based rewrite of <https://github.com/mzucker/imfit>

You will need:

  - TensorFlow (I used v1.3 and 1.7, should work with versions in between as well)
  - PIL or Pillow (for Image loading/saving)
 
To do a full fit, just run [`fitme.sh`](fitme.sh). See that file for
example runtimes and objective function values collected with my
NVidia GTX 1080 GPU. Your runtimes and objective function values may
vary due to hardware differences.
